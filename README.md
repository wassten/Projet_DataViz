# DataViz Project

I wanted to transcribe the information from all the datasets in the form of an article.

The home page allows to see different information on the year 2020 and comparison on the last 4 years where you can choose your department. This one is then updated like all the little extras next to it (even the picture :D ).

For the second part, we have access to all the data set and have several viz according to a region then a department filtered by region (We could have been even more precise until the street of the transaction) On the sidebar we can then choose the year and the type of property. Some more information is added to the viz.

I preferred from the beginning to use all the datasets with all the years by removing only the properties where it misses important information such as the postal code for example.

I also changed the streamlit config files to touch the front a bit and I also added a fixed header and footer to my page for a better immersion (like a real site)

Enjoy your visit!
